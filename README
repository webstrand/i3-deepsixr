#### Introduction
A service for `i3` that watches for `nop` keybindings with special command-words to trigger behavior. Supports left+right navigation of infinite workspaces per-output, as well as stashing and unstashing whole workspaces into the scratchpad.

#### Dependencies
The workspace stasher uses `dmenu` to provide prompts to the user.
  
#### Usage
After starting the application, it runs in the background and monitors i3 for `nop` commands. Here's how to set up your i3 configuration to use the app:

1. **Modify your i3 config file** (usually located at `~/.config/i3/config`) to include keybindings that trigger the application's functions:

```
# Move left or right in the workspace list
bindsym Mod1+Control+Right nop workspace-switcher-right
bindsym Mod1+Control+Left  nop workspace-switcher-left

# Open the workspace un/stasher
bindsym $mod+plus nop workspace-stash-unstash

# Start the service when i3 starts
exec --no-startup-id ~/deepsixr/target/debug/deepsixr
```
